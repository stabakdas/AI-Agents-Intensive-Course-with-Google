##📚 Daily Breakdown

Here's a brief overview of the topics covered each day:

Day 1: Introduction to Agents
This day covered the fundamental concepts of AI agents. It explained what they are, how they differ from traditional LLM applications, and explored the basic "Think-Act-Observe" reasoning loops that form their core architecture.

Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP
This session focused on giving agents real-world capabilities. It demonstrated how agents can "take action" by using tools (like external APIs) and how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) helps them discover and interact with these tools effectively.

Day 3: Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory
This day was all about making agents intelligent over time. It covered techniques for implementing short-term (session) and long-term memory, allowing agents to maintain context, learn from past interactions, and handle complex, multi-turn tasks.

Day 4: Agent Quality
A crucial part of building reliable systems. This session taught methods for evaluating agent performance, ensuring they are safe, effective, and reliable. It covered the importance of observability, logging, and tracing to debug and improve agent behavior.

Day 5: Prototype to Production
The final step in the journey. This day bridged the gap between a working demo and a scalable, real-world application. It covered deployment strategies, best practices for production-ready agents, and the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol for building sophisticated multi-agent systems.

##🚀 Key Topics Covered

This course provided a comprehensive overview of the AI agent stack, including:

Models: The foundational LLMs that power the agent's "brain."

Tools: Enabling agents to interact with the real world by calling external APIs and services.

Orchestration: The logic (like reasoning loops) that governs the agent's behavior.

Memory: Giving agents context and the ability to remember past interactions.

Evaluation: The critical process of ensuring agents are reliable, safe, and effective.
